# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection using Machibe Learning 

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing transaction data, the model can differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent activities. It focuses on preventing financial losses and improving security for banks, financial institutions, and credit card users. The project uses techniques like data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification algorithms to identify potential fraud in real-time or after a transaction has been made.

The project is designed for:

1. Banks & Financial Institutions: To reduce fraud-related financial losses.
2. Credit Card Users: To enhance security and prevent unauthorized transactions.
3. Data Scientists & Analysts: To develop, test, and improve fraud detection systems using machine learning techniques.

#Dataset Information:
Source: The dataset used for this project is typically the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle. It contains anonymized data from European cardholders over two days, including:
Features (X): Various transaction details.
Target (y): The 'Class' column, where:
0 represents a legitimate transaction.
1 represents a fraudulent transaction.
# Preprocessing Steps:
Handling Missing Values: If the dataset contains missing values, techniques like filling with mean/median values or removing incomplete rows can be applied.
Feature Scaling: Due to different ranges in the dataset (e.g., time, amount), features are scaled using methods like StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.
Imbalanced Data: Since fraud cases are rare, resampling techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or undersampling can be applied to balance the dataset.
#Machine Learning Algorithm Used:
Logistic Regression:
A simple and effective binary classification algorithm used to predict fraudulent transactions.
Logistic regression outputs a probability score between 0 and 1, with a threshold of 0.5 for classification.
The model is chosen due to its interpretability and effectiveness on linearly separable data.
# Model Evaluation:
Accuracy Score: Measures the percentage of correctly classified transactions (both fraud and non-fraud). While useful, it may not be the best measure for highly imbalanced datasets.
Precision & Recall: Important metrics in fraud detection, where:
Precision measures the ratio of correctly predicted frauds to the total predicted frauds.
Recall measures how many actual frauds were correctly predicted by the model.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics for better fraud detection performance.
Confusion Matrix: Provides a detailed breakdown of True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN).
# Tools & Technologies:
Python: Programming language used to develop the machine learning model.
Libraries:
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: For model building, preprocessing, and evaluation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing data distribution and performance metrics.
Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab: For interactive development and testing.
6. Challenges Faced:
Class Imbalance: Fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones, which can lead to biased models if not handled properly.
Interpretability: Logistic Regression was chosen for its simplicity and ease of interpreting the results compared to more complex models.
7. Potential Improvements:
Other Models: Consider using ensemble methods like Random Forest, XGBoost, or neural networks to improve the performance on larger datasets.
Real-Time Detection: The model can be deployed into a system that flags transactions in real-time for more efficient fraud prevention.
